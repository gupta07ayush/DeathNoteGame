# DeathNoteGame
A Python Game based on Japanese Anime Death Note:

        1)  The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
      
        2)  This note will not take effect unless the writer has 
            the personâ€™s face in their mind when writing his/her name. 
            Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected
